# Tokenized Logistics Container Management

This repository implements a blockchain-based solution for managing shipping containers throughout the global supply chain. By tokenizing container assets and their associated processes, this system creates a transparent, efficient, and automated approach to container logistics management.

## Core Components

### Container Registration Contract
- Digital registry of shipping container assets and specifications
- Unique digital identifiers for each container in the network
- Container condition assessment and maintenance records
- Ownership and leasing information tracking
- Compliance documentation and certification management

### Booking Contract
- Decentralized reservation system for container space allocation
- Smart contract-based booking confirmation and validation
- Automated payment processing and escrow functionality
- Overbooking prevention through consensus mechanisms
- Integration with shipping schedules and vessel capacity

### Location Tracking Contract
- Real-time container position monitoring across global supply chains
- IoT integration for automated location updates
- Geofencing and route deviation alerts
- Estimated arrival time calculations and updates
- Chain of custody verification at transfer points

### Demurrage Contract
- Automated tracking of container detention periods
- Smart contract enforcement of demurrage charges
- Transparent fee calculation based on actual timestamps
- Dispute resolution mechanism with evidence recording
- Incentive structures for prompt container returns

## Benefits

- **Improved Visibility**: End-to-end tracking of container location and status
- **Reduced Administrative Costs**: Automated processes replace manual documentation
- **Enhanced Security**: Immutable records prevent fraud and documentation errors
- **Optimized Utilization**: Better allocation of container resources
- **Faster Settlements**: Automated payment and fee collection

## Implementation

The system connects shipping lines, freight forwarders, port operators, and beneficial cargo owners through a shared blockchain infrastructure, creating a single source of truth for container logistics information.

## Getting Started

Deployment instructions and API documentation can be found in the implementation guide. The system supports integration with existing logistics management platforms and container tracking systems.
